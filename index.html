            link via Twitter. I honestly didn’t expect much but I didn’t have a
            cook group at the time so I said “what the heck”. Joining N2 was
            probably one of the best moves I made in the realm of cook groups. I
            am not that active in the chat, but I can tell that this place is
            full of amazing people. A few of the best things about N2 have got
            to be the information, partnerships and monitors. The information
            given here is also in such depth and exclusive. N2 was one of the
            only groups to have had all that info on the American Eagle coins.
            On that one drop, I made hundreds. I also really appreciate the
            lowkey cooks. The partnerships are amazing as well. N2 offers some
            amazing discounts on servers, proxies and other tools. Lastly, the
            monitors are legit the fastest. They help so much on footsite
            restocks, SNKRS shock drops or Shopify link changes. N2 is also
            great with early links. I’ve been able to use them and hit a ton of
            drops. In conclusion, I just want to say THANK YOU. You all have
            really helped me step up my game!”</span

            turned into legitimate large profits. I am a newb/green/first

            community drives us forward. Being such an open community, I was
            able to learn from being new to reselling back in April/May to
            consistently hitting releases. I'm still learning how to do better
            every release and I have the N2 fam to guide me through. And if
            you're thinking that just because our group is small and we don't
            get any good groupbuys, well we managed to get chosen for the MekAIO
            competition, multiple bot partnerships and consistent groupbuys for
            other bots/tools/proxies. Also as a Canadian, the group provides an
            adequate amount of information for us, but the information provided
            is diverse and of quality for anyone that wants to start
            reselling.”</span

            are some of the best sources of unbiased and expert information
            among the markets. You will not find a cook group more self less

            staff in the group inspire me to reach a greater level in the
            reseller world, they also inspire me to be better at life. Not going
            to lie, I came into N2 thinking it was going to be a regular cook
            group. But now I can definitely say that I have found a family
            within this group. Not only is this the most professional group I
            have been in, it has been the funniest to be apart of. If I were to
            get asked how to start a cook group N2 would 1000% be the group that
            I would reference off of. I couldn't have asked to be apart of a
            better family. The only thing that I wish I did was find N2 sooner.
            To all the people who are wondering if you should take that next
            step into joining your first cook group, i highly recommended
            joining N2 and when you decide to do so, me and the team will be

            groups and none compare to N2. Any group can provide profitable
            information. Much of the information is the same and redundant. I
            left every single cook group besides N2. What I gained here is a
            family atmosphere. This group helped support me in tough personal
            situations and really helped me pull through. I've always made big
            profits with the info in the group but for me that isn't whats
            important. It's the people. Laughing and having a good time without
            the annoying immature spam in General chat. I have a career outside
            of buying and selling and this group has provided flexibility. I
            used the info to perfect my craft and now there's nothing my family
            wants for. Coincidentally, the people in N2 are a part of my family.
            I've made a bunch of money, could quit my job tomorrow and be fine.
            Life is incredible and N2 played a huge part in that.”</span

            October I believe and I was fairly new to everything. Botting,
            Reselling, Dropshipping, Flipping. All of that. I didn’t know
            anything yet I saw that this group was always popping up on my
            Twitter ads. When I got the chance to join the group I was happy
            cause this was something new I got to explore. I remember literally
            less than a week of joining I bought a lifetime membership because I
            knew this group was going to be insane. And it is! The help,
            support, and eniviroment in here is amazing. There are so many
            people who will help you and make you feel at home and also the info
            in here is insane. The start to success was rough at first not
            knowing much, but thanks to all the valuable information I’ve
            learned in N2, i’m slowly achieving the success that I want to
            attain. ”</span
